### Title

Employee_Manager

### Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. I also used Chalk and Figlet to make a nice presentation screen at the start of the project that says "Employee Manager" in Magenta and Bright Blue. I built 3 tables using mySql and added Foreign Key constraints. In addition, the application allows the user to: * Add departments, roles, employees, * View departments, roles, employees, * Update employee roles and managers, * View employees by manager, * Delete departments, and employees, and * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
